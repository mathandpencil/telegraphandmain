					<h2>Kearney Hall</h2>
					<p>Built in 1867 primarily of limestone, this 3 story building was a mixed-use space consisting of an event hall on the 3rd floor with various enterprises occupying the second and street-level first floors. Throughout the past 140 plus years the building was home to a jewelry store, the Orcutt and Company variety store, apartments, a railroad ticket office, a men's clothing store, a billiard room, the Medina Business Association headquarters, a barber shop, a doctor's office, an Elk's Club, Lutheran church services, a YMCA and most recently a fitness center.</p>

					<h2>Deconstruction</h2>
					<p>
						The first phase of this project is demolition and deconstruction. Much of the building, with the exception of the third floor, has undergone a great deal of altercations and renovations since the buildings original construction. Our goal is to strip the building down, preserving any architecturally significant elements in the process, in order to repair existing infrastructure concerns (electrical, plumbing, etc.)
					</p>
					
					<p>Upon purchase of the building in October 2013, we immediately addressed water leakage in the roof. Our fix will probably not be much of a surprise: a new rolled rubber roof installed by Craig Schrader.</p>

					<h2>Facade Restoration</h2>
					<p>The current facades were reconstructed in the twentieth century, installing a steel frame to support the masonry facade above, and replacing the larger glass storefronts with painted plywood and smaller doors and windows. These facades, in addition to disregarding the historic architecture, have deteriorated and require replacement.</p>
					
					<p>We are proposing a composite collage, matching the dimensions of the historic storefronts, which would be printed on the inside surface of the outer glass layer using grey ceramic frit dot matrix patter. This printing process is inert and protected from the weather and will not fade.</p>
					
					<p>The graphics will reference the original facade design, but at the same time look forward to a new chapter in Medinaâ€™s history. Vistors will simultaneously experience the original facade design, remnants of the twentieth-century reconstruction, and a twenty-first century use of construction technology.</p>

					<h2>Interior Restoration &amp; Business Development</h2>
					<p>We plan to renovate the third floor of the building into a single family home. The second floor will be office space for locally based tech-related startups while also acting as a startup incubator. The first floor will be returned to two, as the building was originally, retail storefronts. More details to come this summer and fall.</p>
